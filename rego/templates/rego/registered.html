  <h3 class="muted"> Why Adobe Illustrator? </h3>
  <p class="lead">
    Adobe Illustrator is a production-standard software for graphic design. <br>
    Unlike MS paint or photoshop, it is a vector-oriented (rather than
    pixel-oriented) graphics design tool. This means that the graphic is made up
    of shapes, rather than pixels. This lends itself very well to designing
    sharp, precise graphic in a short length of time!<br><br>
    However, the toolkit featured in Illustrator is not very intuitive for
    people coming from simpler graphics programs. The purpose of this workshop
    is to give people a quick run-down on the most useful tools in Illustrator,
    and how to use them to get the result you are looking for.<br><br>
    With a bit of practise, you will find that you can draw much faster than you
    would have in Paint or Powerpoint, and with the potential to create much
    more impressive figures, diagrams and pictures. You can even use it to
    touch-up graphs and charts that have been exported from other programs.
